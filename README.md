Links to articles I wrote whilst working as a part-time technical writer @ Deepnote. 

[Deepnote](https://deepnote.com) are working to create "The notebook you’ll love to use." "Deepnote is a new kind of data science notebook. Jupyter-compatible with real-time collaboration and easy deployment." 

I worked part-time as a technical writer for Deepnote in June/July 2020. I wrote a series of articles focusing on social network analysis. Check them out if you are interested!
